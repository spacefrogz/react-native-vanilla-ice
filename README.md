# react-native-vanilla-ice
React Native starter project made with Expo, TypeScript and üíö

### 1. Getting Started:

Clone this project where you prefere on your local machine. You can do this by using the following command:

```bash 
git clone git@github.com:spacefrogz/react-native-vanilla-ice.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies
You'll need to install the packages that will make the app ready to run. Here comes Yarn to help! You can follow the instructions that are provided [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for getting Yarn on your machine.

Once you have it all set up, just fire up a terminal in the project's root directory and run: 

```bash 
yarn
```
or
```bash 
yarn install
```
### 3. Expo and Starting the app
Make an [Expo](https://expo.dev/signup) account and use [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go) app to run the app. On your device install the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go) app and connect your device to the same network as your development machine.
Fire up a terminal in the project's root directory and run:

```bash
yarn start
```

If everything went smooth, you'll be provided with a QR code inside the terminal. Scan it and open the app via Expo Go on your device! (note that you'll need an Expo acocunt for this)

#### You can also run:
```bash
yarn ios
```
or
```bash
yarn android
```
and Expo will fire up an iOS simulator or Android emulator to run the app. For this you'll need to have XCode and Android Studio installed and set up.
More details about the set up [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
